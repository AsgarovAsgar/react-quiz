## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd react-quiz
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development servers:

```bash
# Start the JSON Server (in one terminal)
npm run server

# Start the React development server (in another terminal)
npm start
```

**Important Note:** You must run both servers simultaneously. The JSON Server (`npm run server`) is essential as it provides the quiz data to the application. Without running the JSON Server, the application will not be able to fetch or display any quiz questions.
